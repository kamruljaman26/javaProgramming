     * Write a method that takes a string (upper case only) as a parameter and that returns a
     * histogram of the letters in the string. The ith element of the histogram should contain
     * the number of ith character in the string alphabet.
     * For example, if the user types in a string “AAABBEECEDEDEDDDE”, then the string alphabet
     *        is “(A,B,E,C,D)”. The output could be something like this:
     *        Please input a string:
     *        > AAABBEECEDEDEDDDE
     *        The histogram is:
     *        A xxx
     * B xx
     * E xxxxxx Cx
     * D xxxxx
